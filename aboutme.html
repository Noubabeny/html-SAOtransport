        Move would see Russia leapfrog US and India in terms of number of active combat soldiers. Beijing has just over 2 million active servicemen
        Russian President President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the regular size of the Russian army to be increased by 180,000 troops to 1.5 million active servicemen in a move that would make it the second largest in the world after China's.
        
        In a decree published on the Kremlin's website, Putin ordered the overall size of the armed forces to be increased to 2.38 million people, of which he said 1.5 million should be active servicemen.
        Vinícius Jr had opened the scoring from the penalty spot after Sergio Gómez’s handball.

When the Brazilian was fouled inside the box in the 75th minute, he decided to hand over the ball to Mbappe.

“[Vinícius and I] try to find each other in the game and in training to find that connection, he’s a great player.

“The important thing is that the four penalties [so far this season] were goals, not who takes them.
“We scored all four, and that’s the most important thing,” Mbappe told Real Madrid TV.
